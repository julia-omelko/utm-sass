Your access to and use of the Services are conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. When you subscribe to the Services and download the application,             you are certifying to <b>YouThisMe™</b> that you are eligible to receive products exported from the United States, without any restrictions.             By accessing or using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms.        </p>        <h3>1. BASIC TERMS</h3>        <p>            You are responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you transmit to others, and for any consequences thereof. The Content is stored in encrypted form on            <b>YouThisMe™</b> central computing systems and is not capable of being decrypted without special information created at the time of use. The “innocent” messages             (“UTMs,” i.e. messages that cloak your Content) are computer generated and may use randomly selected names, objects and places. UTMs are designed to appear like common sentences,             exclamations, or observations. There is no claim to the veracity of the content of UTMs. You are responsible for any consequences of transmitting such UTMs to other parties.             You may change the content of UTMs to clarify the nature of your communication to members of a communication group you&#39;ve created (“<b>MyHort™</b>”). The actual content of UTMs,             the modifications you make to UTMs, and their reception by <b>MyHort™</b> members, is completely your responsibility. UTMs may be viewed by the outside world since they will appear             on SMS client software on cellular phones, mobile devices and other computing devices. Furthermore, UTMs can appear on Twitter™, on Facebook™, or on other postings of your choice on             the Internet. Since the content of UTMs is meant to be commonplace and without significance, they can be viewed by others and presumably do not reflect actual intended content of             communication. Any UTMs that reflect actual facts or states of affairs by you are entirely coincidental. Services are used by purchasing messages units or time periods for service             (“<b>Fees</b>”) as purveyed on our website. Your use of Services will be terminated with no notice if Fees are not paid. You may use the Services only if you can form a binding             contract with <b>YouThisMe™</b> and are not a person barred from receiving Services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. If you are accepting             these Terms and using the Services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so.             You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations.            The Services that <b>YouThisMe™</b> provides are always evolving and the form and nature of the Services that <b>YouThisMe™</b> provides may change from time to time without             prior notice to you. In addition, <b>YouThisMe™</b> may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users             generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice. We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time without prior notice             to you.        </p>        <h3>2.

Waiver and Severability</h4>        <p>            The failure of <b>YouThisMe™</b> to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.

All claims, legal proceedings or litigation arising in connection with the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts             located in Columbia County, New York, United States, and you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum. If             you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services in your official capacity and legally unable to accept the controlling law,             jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not apply to you.

When you use <span class="content-bold">YouThisMe</span>&reg;, your friends know ahead of time that you&#39;re using this special method of communicating.  </p> <h2 class="content">OK, give me an example. </h2> <p>Kate wants to warn her friend Cindy that something she said shouldn&#39;t be mentioned to Hank. She&#39;s worried about texting it, since Hank sometimes sees Cindy&#39;s phone in plain sight.But, Kate really needs to tell her *now* not to tell Hank about what she said.Email might not work, and Kate&#39;s worried about leaving voice mail.  </p> <h2 class="content content-header-who">What to do? </h2> <p><span class="content-bold">YouThisMe</span>&reg; comes to the rescue: </p> <p>Kate opens her <span class="content-bold">YouThisMe</span>&reg; app on her smartphone and types her message to Cindy. </p> <img src="http://www.youthisme.com/Content/Images/content/whatExample1.png" width="100%" /> <p>But when Cindy looks at the message from Kate on her phone it reads; </p> <img src="http://www.youthisme.com/Content/Images/content/whatExample2.png" width="100%" /> <p>Kate&#39;s message about the weather might appear as a text on Cindy&#39;s smartphone, on Kate&#39;s timeline on Twitter, or posted as her status on Facebook. Nothing is mentioned about Hank. Since Cindy and Kate have been using <span class="content-bold">YouThisMe</span>&reg; to exchange messages, Cindy knows that the message from Cindy is a signal – hidden in plain sight – for her to open her <span class="content-bold">YouThisMe</span>&reg; app and retrieve the real message. </br> So, Kate&#39;s message about Hank is "hidden" in some chatter about the weather. Even if Hank could read the message, Kate&#39;s real message is never revealed, except to Cindy.  <h2 class="content">Hmmm sounds interesting. But, am I limited to 160 characters in regular text messages or 140 characters on Twitter? </h2> NO! You can send thousands or millions of characters. You can even send pictures. Everything you send is changed to a short text message that conceals what you really sent. </br>Read how <span class="content-bold">YouThisMe</span>&reg; works <a class="content-link" href="WhatWeDo">here</a>.';
